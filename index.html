                <h2>Learning Reflection & Cultural Exploration</h2>
                <h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Before this course, the only thing I knew about Chinese was how to say hello. But I didn't even know the proper way to say it with the correct tones. I was maybe familiar with some of the characters because of my Japanese knowledge, but most of everything was new to me. I remember watching the John Cena "Bing Chilling" video and not understanding what he was saying, but I realized a couple weeks ago that I can completely understand what he says for the first few seconds! So I thought it was pretty cool (and funny) that I could use that video as a way to see how far my Chinese has improved since the beginning. Everytime I see my Chinese-speaking friend on campus, he always tries talking to me in Chinese, and each time I get to show off more of what I learned and impress him! I think that was a pretty good motivator for me to keep practicing and learning more. Going from only being able to read Pinyin at the beginning of the semester to being able to read and understand an entire passage of Chinese characters is also really cool. I've realized that I keep trying to read signs and texts in Chinese that I see out in the real world and I'm surprised to find out that I can interpret at least part of the meanings of these texts by recognizing characters that I've learned.</p>
                    <p>From what I've learned since the beginning of the semester, I am now able to greet a stranger and introduce myself and what I do. I can also describe my family and my preferences for food, drinks and activities, and I can use dates and times to specify the time that something happens. I am also able to ask questions about someone's name, occupation, age, birthday, preferences and family, using question words like who, what, where, when and why. I think with all of these, I am at least able to hold a decent conversation with a stranger, and even invite them out to do something sometime. There are also some cultural topics that I've learned, including Chinese names, occupations, family structure, pastimes and food.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning, I had an idea that knowledge on identifying characters and the skill to accurately pronounce syllables using the Chinese phonetic system would be the most important to work on. I've always heard that how you pronounce words in Chinese is extremely important because tones can hold meaning. In all of the other languages I've learnt, I've spent a lot of time trying to replicate how a native speaker pronounces words, and I think I am pretty good at doing the same in Mandarin. I also think the learning objectives about intercultural competence and interdisciplinary competence are also important. After all, one of the reasons someone might learn a new language is to be able to communicate, share and interact with the culture in which the language is spoken. I am pretty certain that I want to keep learning Chinese, so the objective of developing strategies to contribute to my lifelong learning is something that I should focus on. I know that if I don't continuously practice and learn new things, my learning and knowledge will grow stagnant and I may even forget what I've learned. I think I'll spend more of my freetime searching for Chinese media to learn from.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Exploration</h3>
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>In one of my OP sessions this term, I had a practice partner named Keyi. I forget the second character in her name, but the first was 可 as in 可以. And much like 可以, her name had the same pronunciation. She told me that her parents likely named her that as a form of encouragement, like "you can do whatever you set your mind to." I thought that was really interesting because her name has a story that was personalized by the people who named her. This is pretty unlike in English speaking cultures, where you might meet multiple people with the same full name. I think that in China, names are an important thing for people. Last names are passed down through many generations, and each given name seems to be given with lots of care and thought behind it. Learning about these cultural differences is super interesting and it makes me want to learn about the meanings of other Chinese people's names.</p>
                    <p>I think one of the coolest parts in getting to know someone is sharing each other's cultures. I have a friend from Macau who is really into Mahjong, and one day he taught me how to play it. I sometimes play with him at the Mahjong club at school, though I'm not very good. But I think it's something interesting that I was able to learn by him sharing things about his culture and where he's from. I actually think that exposure to these cultural differences is part of the reason why I was interested in learning Chinese in the first place. I probably wouldn't have enrolled randomly without some sort of exposure. I believe that learning about a culture is a really good motivator to learn the language they speak. I think that I'll keep this idea in my mind when interacting with people of different backgrounds in the future to keep myself open to the idea of learning about new cultures and (maybe) new languages.</p>

                <h2>Character, Character, Everywhere</h2>
                <img src="images/my-home.png" width="1000">
                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Character: 家</p>
                    <p>Meaning: home, family</p>
                    <p>Structure: Roof radical 宀, pig radical 豕. Top to bottom structure.</p>
                    <p>Context: This is a restaurant in the International Food Court in University Village.</p>
                    <p>Significance: The full Chinese name is 我家, literally "My home." From what I understand, this is a family-run business. The name gives off a welcoming feel, almost like they are inviting you into their home to eat their home-cooked food. The name gives it a personal touch that I think is really nice.</p>
                    <p>Personal Importance: I eat here usually at least once a week. Their food is pretty good, fairly cheap (for on-campus food, at least) and always super quick to order. There is something comforting about coming here when you're really hungry and tired, ordering some food and just sitting there quietly eating it. It's funny that I didn't notice the Chinese writing at the end of the sign until about a month ago. I recommend the Mapo tofu and the green beans.</p>

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Character: 茶</p>
                    <p>Meaning: tea</p>
                    <p>Structure: Grass radical 艹. Top to bottom structure.</p>
                    <p>Context: Green tea bottle I bought from H-Mart.</p>
                    <p>
                        Significance: Doing some research, it seems that tea was invented in China in about 2700 BC. Over the years, other cultures were exposed to tea through trades. First, it was Asian cultures like Japan, and later on European countries like Britain. Tea plays a big role in cultures all over the world. For instance, Chinese tea culture holds spiritual connotations 
                        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_tea_culture" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). 
                        Chinese tea culture embodies ideas of "harmony, peace, happiness and truthfulness." Physical health is also thought to be tied closely to their tea culture. Tea culture is also thought of as a form of art in many cultures, such as tea ceremonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>Personal Importance: I sometimes buy this if I don't bring tea from home. It says it's Japanese tea but it's written in Chinese, but it's still pretty good. I usually get this one over the Japanese ones because it's like a dollar cheaper and tastes good enough for me, since I'm not very picky. I grew up drinking Japanese tea and saying the Japanese word for tea (also 茶, pronounced cha) so the character for tea is burned into my brain and is kind of nostalgic for me.</p>
